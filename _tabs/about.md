Welcome to this corner of the cyber world! My name is **Siddharth Joshi**, I'm a full-time penetration tester at Bulletproof(Cyber Security). My passion lies in uncovering hidden vulnerabilities across web, mobile, and network platformsâ€”think of me as a digital treasure hunter, but instead of gold, I'm searching for security flaws.

In my spare time, I make the internet a safer place by reporting application and system vulnerabilities to local and foreign companies. (A very professional way to say bug bounty, haha.)

I've collected a few shiny certifications along the way, including the OSCP (OffSec Certified Professional), CREST CPSA (CREST Practitioner Security Analyst), CRT (CREST Registered Penetration Tester), Certified Network Pentester (CNPen), and Certified AppSec Pentester (CAPen). And yes, the list is still growing, because in cybersecurity, there's always something new to learn!

So, whether you're here to explore the latest in security techniques or just curious about the cyber world, you're in good company. Stick around as we dive into the fascinating world of cybersecurity together!

Many Thanks,
Siddharth
